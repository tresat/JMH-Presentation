PROJECT SETUP

*You may have to edit /demos/jmhdemos/demo-ucms/build.gradle to replace "C:/ucms/dev" with your local UCMS install directory (containing all the client jars) before starting.*

See the instructions in /doc/SETUP.txt

RUNNING

Run "gradlew tasks" from the JMH-Presentation directory to see a list of tasks
Run "gradlew <TASK_NAME> from the JMH-Presentation directory to run that task
Run "gradlew simple-all" to run the Simple Benchmarker demo.
Run "gradlew jmh" to run all JMH demos - this will output human readable results.csv files in each sub-projects' /build/reports/jmh/human.txt file.
Run "gradlew plot" to run all JMH demos and plot the results (this will require installing the matplotlib python library, see instructions in /chart/doc/SETUP.txt).

PROJECT LAYOUT

/chart
Python script to plot the csv results of a jmh run to a chart saved in .png format using the "plot" task from gradle.

/demos
Tom's JMH demos.
/demos/simplebenchmarker
Contains a gradle sub-project demonstrating a naive benchmarker implementation.
/demos/jmhdemos
Contains Tom's custom JMH demos, each in a folder containing a gradle sub-project.

/doc
Documentation for the presentation, slides, setup notes, etc.

/gradle
Autogenerated gradle wrapper files - DO NOT MODIFY.

/jmhrunner
A self-contained NON-sub-project gradle project  which should be able to quickly be cut-and-pasted and modified to use as a template to create your own benchmarks.  Run "gradlew plot" from this directory to execute JMH and plot the results.

/jmh-samples
A gradle sub-project containing all the jmh sample files from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/tip/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/ set up to run and plot as part of the main project.
