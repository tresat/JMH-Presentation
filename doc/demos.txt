Ctrl+F11 to run

- Runs operation X number of times, in warmup + test runs, calculates average in terms of ops/millisecond
-- HIGHER NUMBERS are FASTER operations
- Each run yields slightly different results
- JVM is an Adaptive VM
-- bytecode first interpreted
-- then native code generated by JIT, as needed (subject to variations)

Demo 01
- What does this result mean?  ...hmmm

Demo 02
- Let's compare it to a constant   
- WHAT!  More ops of DISTANCE computation than CONSTANT?  ...hmmm

Demo 03
- Let's try with NOTHING
- WHAT!  Doing NOTHING is slower than either  ...hmmm

This is the first lesson: mixing benchmarks within the same JVM run is wrong
Let's change the order

Demo 04
- Same as last run, but with NOTHING first, then DISTANCE, then CONSTANT
- We get the same relative throughput drop figures, with the LAST run being the SLOWEST!

Demo 05 
- Run each benchmark alone
- Times come out about EQUAL
