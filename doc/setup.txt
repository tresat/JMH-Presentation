SETUP

This assumes you have both Gradle and the Gradle IDE for Eclipse already installed.

To install gradle use GVM - http://sdkman.io/
To install Gradle IDE for Eclipse search the Eclipse Marketplace for "Gradle Integration for Eclipse"

If you are working with Gradle behind a proxy, you will need to configure Gradle with proxy information so it can download dependencies.
In your user directory (e.g. c:\users\steve or /users/steve), open the .gradle folder (you may need to enable hidden folders on your file browser). open the gradle.properties file. If it does not exist, create it.
Add the following lines with the values replaced with the values specific to your proxy:
systemProp.http.proxyHost=www.proxyhost.org
systemProp.http.proxyPort=8080
systemProp.http.proxyUser=userid
systemProp.http.proxyPassword=password
systemProp.http.nonProxyHosts=*.nonproxyrepos.com|localhost

1) Run "gradlew eclipse" from the JMH-Presentation directory
2) Open eclipse, go to Project->Import, choose Type = Gradle project.  Point to the JMH-Presentation directory and include sub-projects.

RUNNING

1) Run "gradlew tasks" from the JMH-Presentation directory to see a list of tasks
2) Run "gradlew <TASK_NAME> from the JMH-Presentation directory to run that task
