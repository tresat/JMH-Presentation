PROJECT SETUP

Gradle

To install gradle use GVM - http://sdkman.io/

If you are working with Gradle behind a proxy, you will need to configure Gradle with proxy information so it can download dependencies.
In your user directory (e.g. c:\users\steve or /users/steve), open the .gradle folder (you may need to enable hidden folders on your file browser). open the gradle.properties file. If it does not exist, create it.
Add the following lines with the values replaced with the values specific to your proxy:
systemProp.http.proxyHost=www.proxyhost.org
systemProp.http.proxyPort=8080
systemProp.http.proxyUser=userid
systemProp.http.proxyPassword=password
systemProp.http.nonProxyHosts=*.nonproxyrepos.com|localhost

Eclipse

To install Gradle IDE for Eclipse search the Eclipse Marketplace for "Gradle Integration for Eclipse"

1) Run "gradlew eclipse" from the jmhrunner directory to generate eclipse project files.
2) Open eclipse, go to Project->Import, choose Type = Gradle project.  Point to the jmhrunner directory and import it.
